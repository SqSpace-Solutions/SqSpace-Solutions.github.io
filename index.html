        <div class="service-box">
            <h3>Scientific Manuscript Editing & Experimental Strategy Feedback</h3>
            <p>I provide in-depth scientific editing for research manuscripts, and scientific reports in the life 
                sciences. My service includes critical evaluation of experimental design, data 
                interpretation, and scientific rigor. I help clarify hypotheses, strengthen logic, ensure methodological transparency, 
                and align conclusions with the presented evidence, while preserving the author’s scientific voice. 
                I also offer constructive, non-directive feedback on experimental gaps, controls, and next-step strategies 
                to enhance the overall impact and credibility of the work.</p>

        <div class="service-box">
            <h3>Laboratory Setup & Optimization Coaching for Clinical and Startup Environments</h3>
            <p>I coach clinical laboratories and biotech startups in the planning, setup, and optimization of laboratory spaces, 
                from early-stage design to operational readiness. This includes guidance on workflow layout, equipment selection, 
                biosafety considerations, sample handling pipelines, and scalability planning. Drawing on hands-on academic and applied 
                lab experience, I help teams build efficient, compliant, and future-ready laboratory environments that support 
                reproducible science, regulatory expectations, and organizational growth.</p>

        <div class="service-box">
            <h3>Scientific Content Creation & LLM Training and Editing</h3>
            <p>I create, curate, and refine high-quality scientific content for editorials, training, evaluating, and improving large language 
                models (LLMs) in the life sciences. This includes writing and editing domain-accurate biological texts, annotating and 
                validating scientific data, and reviewing model-generated outputs for factual accuracy, clarity, and 
                soundness. Leveraging deep subject-matter expertise in biology, I help ensure that AI systems are trained on reliable,
                well-structured, and context-aware scientific information suitable for research, clinical, and translational applications.</p>
